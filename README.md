objective

The Weather Forecast App is a real-time, interactive web application that allows users to check current weather conditions and a short-term forecast for their chosen location. By integrating with a weather API (like OpenWeatherMap), the app dynamically fetches data and displays it in an intuitive, user-friendly format.

Features:
1. Search Functionality: Users can search for weather data by city name.
2. Dynamic Data Display: Temperature, humidity, weather conditions, and other metrics are displayed in real-time.
3. Dynamic Backgrounds: Background visuals change based on the weather (e.g., sunny, rainy).
4.Responsive Design: Fully functional across desktop and mobile devices.

Purpose:

Provide an accessible and interactive way for users to check weather conditions.
